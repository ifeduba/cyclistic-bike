# Analysis
 User Type Distribution
Members accounted for a higher number of rides compared to casual users.

This suggests that Cyclistic has a strong base of returning users, but there is potential for growth by converting casual riders into members.


 Ride Duration
Casual riders tend to have longer ride durations than members on average.

Members generally take shorter, more consistent trips, likely for commuting purposes.

3. Rideable Type Usage
The most frequently used bike type was classic bikes, followed by electric bikes.

Casual users showed a higher preference for electric bikes, likely due to their ease and convenience.
Time and Day Trends
Casual riders are more active during weekends and afternoons, indicating recreational usage.

Members ride mostly on weekdays during morning and evening hours, reflecting work commutes.
# ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights & Recommendations

Marketing Strategy: Target casual riders who frequently use the service on weekends with discounted membership offers.

Bike Availability: Increase electric bike availability in recreational areas to meet casual demand.

Membership Campaign: Highlight the benefits of membership to users with long or frequent rides.

Infrastructure Planning: Use peak station data to optimize bike distribution and maintenance schedules.
